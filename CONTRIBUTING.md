# Contributing

## Updating

General updates are best done whenever creating a new project since that new project had best start out on the right foot with the latest versions, and doing such kills two birds with one stone by also keeping this template updated.

- `git clone https://github.com/acalvino4/craft-boilerplate.git`
- `git checkout -b update-mm-yyyy`
- `ddev update` for automatic updates
- `ddev composer outdated` && `ddev npm outdated` to check for manual updates
- perform manual updates
- check for php, node, redis, and postgres LTS updates, and perform if availible and compatible (updating this README and the ddev config)
- `ddev test`
- push and merge

## Todo

- db backup in new project bootstrap process?
- GDPR compliance
- Image transforms
- github actions deployment file
  - Composer deps for pipeline builds
  - Implement caching in pipeline
- come up with a good 'children' construct (as in jsx) for twig - [github discussion](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/12671)
- consider other less restrictive licenses that don't require license to be included in derivative works
- determine purpose of readme vs contributing docs
